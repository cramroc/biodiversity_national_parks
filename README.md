# Biodiversity in National Parks

This project analyzes biodiversity data from U.S. national parks to understand species conservation status, distribution, and observation trends.

## Overview

Using datasets on species characteristics and park observations, this notebook investigates:
- How conservation status varies across species categories (mammals, birds, plants, etc.)
- Which parks have the highest biodiversity
- Observation trends for selected species

## Project Structure

- `biodiversity.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with full analysis and visualizations
- `species_info.csv` - List of all species tracked, their categories, and conservation status
- `observations.csv` - Species observation counts by park
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Requirements:
- Python3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed distinct patterns in species conservation and distribution across national parks. Mammals and birds stand out as highly endangered, with vascular plants being underrepresented in conservation efforts. Statistical tests confirmed the significance of these disparities. Observations further highlighted the Warbler as the most prevalent species, with Yellowstone hosting the highest diversity and quantity. These findings emphasize the need for targeted conservation strategies tailored to both plant and animal species across different parks.

## Data Source

The datasets used in this project were provided by Codecademy. They include simulated species records and observation data from U.S. National Parks.
